      <h2>1. Preamble: Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>This Data Sovereignty Protocol ("Protocol") establishes the absolute terms governing the collection, processing, and retention of all data generated by your interaction with the NASMA International FZCO ("we," "us," "our") digital properties. By accessing this website, you irrevocably consent to the practices described herein. Continued use constitutes your binding and unconditional acceptance of this Protocol. If you do not agree to these terms in their entirety, you are expressly prohibited from accessing this site and must discontinue use immediately.</p>
      
      <h2>2. Scope of Data Acquisition</h2>
      <p>We engage in comprehensive data collection to ensure the security of our operations and the integrity of our clientele. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Voluntary Data</strong>: Information you submit via forms (e.g., "Request Access").</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Data</strong>: Information collected automatically, including your IP address, device fingerprint (hardware model, operating system, browser type), precise geolocation data, and your complete activity log on this site (pages visited, duration, clickstream data).</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>: We utilize cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to facilitate this collection. Our purpose is threat analysis, security enforcement, and internal audit.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>3. Purpose of Processing</h2>
      <p>Your data is processed exclusively for our legitimate interests, which supersede your own. These interests include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Evaluating and vetting inquiries for potential engagement.</li>
        <li>Protecting our assets, intellectual property, and operational security from espionage, fraud, and unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Conducting internal analysis to improve our defensive measures and operational protocols.</li>
        <li>Complying with lawful requests from government and regulatory bodies within the United Arab Emirates and internationally.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. User Rights & Our Prerogatives</h2>
      <p>Due to the classified nature of our work and obligations to our governing body, your rights are severely circumscribed. We reserve the right to deny any user request—including requests for access, correction, or deletion of data—if we deem that fulfilling such a request:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Could compromise our commercial or operational security.</li>
        <li>Would violate a legal or contractual obligation to a third party or state entity.</li>
        <li>Is frivolous or vexatious in nature.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All decisions made by our security committee regarding your data are final.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Data Retention & International Transfer</h2>
      <p>We retain all data for a period we determine necessary to fulfill our security and operational objectives, which may be indefinite. Data may be transferred to and processed in any country where we or our partners (including manufacturing facilities in Guangdong Province, China) operate. You understand that these jurisdictions may not offer the same level of data protection as your own.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Security & Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>While we employ advanced cryptographic and physical security measures commensurate with our risk profile, we explicitly disclaim liability for any infiltration of our systems that occurs through means beyond our reasonable control, including state-sponsored cyber-attacks or zero-day exploits.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Amendments</h2>
      <p>We unilaterally reserve the right to modify this Protocol at any time and for any reason. The updated version will be effective immediately upon posting. Your continued use of the site after any change signifies your absolute acceptance of the new terms.</p>
