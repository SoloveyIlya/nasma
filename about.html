            Established in June 2023 and based in the Dubai Digital Park, NASMA International was founded on the principle of transforming visionary concepts into market-ready medical technology. We provide an end-to-end solution—from initial design and engineering to certified mass production at our partner facilities in Guangdong Province.<br><br>
            Our operational protocols and manufacturing partnerships are aligned with the stringent standards and oversight of our governing body, ensuring that every project meets the highest levels of compliance, security, and performance. We do not seek volume; we seek significance, working exclusively on projects that push the boundaries of what is possible in medical science.<br><br>
            <b>Our focus areas include remote health monitoring, bio-augmentation, advanced mobility systems, and the production of sophisticated custom medical hardware.</b><br><br>
